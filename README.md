# 🧠 Conversation Intelligence AI  
### Your AI-Powered Real-Time Meeting Assistant

> Transform conversations into actionable intelligence — instantly.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Conversation Intelligence AI** is a real-time, AI-driven meeting assistant designed to enhance sales and client interactions.  
It listens to live conversations, converts speech into text, and delivers intelligent insights such as objections, intent, sentiment, and next-best actions — all in real time.

This system acts as a **live AI coach**, helping users navigate conversations more effectively and improve decision-making during meetings.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Assist users during live client conversations
- Identify critical signals such as objections and hesitation
- Provide real-time suggestions to improve communication
- Reduce the risk of deal loss through intelligent warnings
- Simulate “hindsight intelligence” using AI-driven pattern reasoning

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

In real-world sales and client-facing scenarios:

- Important signals (like objections or hesitation) are often missed
- Users struggle to respond effectively under pressure
- Post-meeting analysis is delayed and inefficient
- No lightweight tool provides **live, in-meeting intelligence**

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

This project introduces a **real-time conversation intelligence system** that:

1. Captures live voice input during meetings  
2. Converts speech into text continuously  
3. Sends conversation chunks to an AI engine  
4. Analyzes context using natural language processing  
5. Returns structured insights instantly

---

### 🧠 6. Hindsight Intelligence (Simulated)
- Generates pattern-based insights
- Mimics learning from past conversations
- Provides contextual guidance

---

### ❤️ 7. Human-Centered AI Experience
- Friendly, non-robotic tone
- Acts like a supportive assistant
- Enhances user confidence

### 🔍 Workflow Explanation

1. **Voice Capture**
   - User speaks during a live meeting
   - Browser captures audio using microphone

2. **Speech-to-Text Conversion**
   - Web Speech API converts voice into text in real time

3. **Chunking Mechanism**
   - Text is grouped into meaningful chunks before sending to backend
   - Reduces API calls and improves performance

4. **Backend Processing**
   - FastAPI receives text input
   - Sends prompt to AI model for analysis

5. **AI Analysis**
   - Detects:
     - Objections
     - Intent
     - Sentiment
     - Risk signals
   - Generates suggestions and insights

6. **Real-Time UI Update**
   - Insights are displayed instantly on the dashboard
   - Acts as a live assistant during conversation
